# Manual Testing Assessment

## Q1 | Requirement Analysis
A shoe-selling e-commerce platform. The client wanted to implement a new feature: **"Search"**. During the client meeting, they mentioned they wanted the search to be dynamic, capable of handling any keywords or specific text. As part of the initial process, I had opportunity to ask detailed questions to clarify the requirements.  
**Task:** Listed 10 questions to ask the client, prioritizing them by importance.



## Q2 | Test Case Design
Based on the 10 questions identified in Q1, wrote test cases to verify the functionality of the search feature. Ensuring that the test cases cover all identified scenarios and are structured appropriately.



## Q3 | Test Execution on Evershop
Assuming that the development team has implemented the feature on the Evershop site (https://demo.evershop.io/). Executed test cases on the site and generated a detailed report based on my findings.



## Q4 | Happy Path Journey
Performed the following actions to validate the search and cart functionality:
1. Searched for the text **“Nike react phantom run flyknit 2”**.
2. Added a couple of **small-sized black products** to your cart.
3. Verified the cart for correct product details, quantities, and pricing.

Executed these steps through both the **API** and the **UI**, then:
- Provided feedback on my test analysis.
- Documented any defects I encountered in detailed logs.
- Generated a comprehensive report based on my findings.
